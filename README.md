# Amazon-distribution-channels
This project consists of analyzing distribution channels on Amazon.com to optimize the sellers' decision choice of distributors. The analysis also comprises a deeper dive into customer reviews in order to identify product issues, complaints, and an attempt to classify review ratings as emerging from a customer experience stand point or a product value stand point.
