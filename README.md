# Amazon-distribution-channels
This project consists of analyzing distribution channels on Amazon.com to optimize the sellers' decision choice of distributors. The analysis also comprises a deeper dive into customer reviews in order to identify product issues, complaints, and an attempt to classify review ratings as emerging from a customer experience stand point or a product value stand point.

### Note:
As this project is potentially yielding a product, we decided not to open source our proprietary code. We did instead open source our scraper for the benefit of the developer community.
Feel free to contact us with questions about the project or help with using the scraper.
