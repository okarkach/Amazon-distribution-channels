       "  \"I just bought my Nespresso Inissia online, and I wanted to make sure I had some capsules ready for when my Inissia arrived. This review is intended for new owners that are looking for a variety of Nespresso capsules.  At the time of this posting, I've had my Inissia for 36 hours.I went with five stars to offset a lot of the older posts that attack the other listings based on value.  Yes, you can most likely getmore bang from your buck if you make a large purchase from the Nespresso site, but sometimes that's not the best choice for the individual. I want this review to give you a breakdown of the flavors you get, and let you judge if it is the right purchase for you.First off, I wanted to point out that the Inissia comes bundled with a variety pack of 14 capsules. It's a pretty good variety from their various offerings.  There is one vanilla, one decaf, and the other 12 cover a range of their Grand Cru capsules.  Intenso, Espresso, Pure Origin, Lungo, Decaffeinato, and Variations (flavored) are all represented.  Honestly, if I had to do it over again, I would have sampled the various offerings, and then made a large purchase directly from Nespresso. However, I know that may not be the right option for everyone, so read on if you want a breakdown of the five flavors representedThe five capsules offered in this five pack are listed below.  Descriptions are taken from the Nespresso site:CAPRICCIO (from the Espresso line)Intensity: 5RICH AND DISTINCTIVE:Blending South American Arabicas with a touch of Robusta, Capriccio is an espresso with a rich aroma and a strong typical cereal note.OriginThe presence of South American Arabicas grown at high altitude gives this blend a light acidity, which is balanced with the perfect amount of Brazilian Arabica and a touch of Robusta.RoastingThe light roasting of this blend creates a rich character and preserves a light acidity.Aromatic ProfileA typical cereal note balanced with a light acidity.ARPEGGIO (from the Intenso line)Intensity: 9INTENSE AND CREAMY:A dark roast of pure South and Central American Arabicas,Arpeggio has a strong character and intense body, enhanced by cocoa notes.OriginA selection of the best South and Central American Arabicas, with fruity or malted profiles, characteristic of Costa Rican coffees.RoastingArpeggio is roasted intensely to bring out the characteristics of each origin. Its full body develops from the fine grinding of the beans.Aromatic ProfileIntense, grilled notes alongside subtle cocoa notes and woody hints.LIVANTO (from the Espresso line)Intensity: 6ROUND AND BALANCED:A blend of pure Arabica from South and Central America,Livanto is a well-balanced espresso characterized by a roasted caramelized note.OriginThis blend is composed of the most prestigious Central and South American Arabicas, found in Costa Rica and Colombia and is cultivated according to traditional methods to preserve their malted and fruity profiles.RoastingA medium roasting, accentuates malted notes, whilst fruity notes evolve to create a complex and delicate caramelized bouquet.Aromatic ProfileA round and balanced profile, typical of freshly roasted coffee results in a combination of cereal, malted and caramelized notes as well as fine fruity notes.ROMA (from the Intenso line)Intensity: 8FULL AND BALANCED:The balance of lightly roasted South and Central American Arabicas with Robusta, gives Roma sweet and woody notes and a full, lasting taste on the palate.OriginCultivated at high altitude, the Central American Arabicas bring finesse, whilst the Brazilian Arabicas and Robustas provide body and a lingering taste on the palate.RoastingLight roasting and fine grinding bring finesse to the blend and create a short espresso, which is not too strong.Aromatic ProfileRoasted and woody notes are revealed through the light roasting of intensely flavoured beans from different origins.RISTRETTO (from the Intenso line)Intensity: 10POWERFUL AND CONTRASTING:A blend of South American and East African Arabicas, with a touch of Robusta, roasted separately to create the subtle fruity note of this full-bodied, intense espresso.OriginComposed of some of the best South American Arabicas from sources such as Colombia and Brazil, Ristretto also contains the great, lightly acidic East African Arabicas and a touch of Robusta for added zing.RoastingThe beans are roasted slowly and separately to obtain an original bouquet bringing together acidic, fruity, and roasted notes. Its finely ground texture creates an Italian-style coffee: intense, with a rich flavour and full body.Aromatic ProfileStrong roasted notes softened by notes of chocolate. A subtle contrast between strength and bitterness, acidic and fruity notes.ConclusionThis is a pretty good variety pack if you want a fairly standard selection.  You're not going to get outliers like Lungo, Decaffeinato, Variations, or the Pure Origin series.  If you want to buy in bulk, then buying here may not be the most cost effective option. However, if you want to try five different Espressos that are all good and fairly standard, this is a pretty good representation if the math works out.  By all means, shop around and find the best bargain, but this is a good representation.\",\n",
       "  \"I should have listened to the other negative reviews! 3 of the 6 Nespresso boxes showed up smashed when the amazon box it was packaged in looked brand new.

Last time all the packages are labled in Asian languages (Chinese and Thai) which are different from the packages I received before. These products might be for Asian markets - quality of the product should be fine but it makes me suspect the source of these products. The thing that makes me really worried is that several capsules have weird tastes this time and I dare try no more. I am too lazy to return but will never purchase from this shop any more. As many comments point out, the price from official Nespresso online shop is competitive, more secure, and with much larger range of selection.',\n",

I did get a reply from the seller who says they don't Pack it, Amazon does..  Well be that as it may..  several capsules weren't usable  at 70 plus cents a pop,  that added up.  I put pics up..  what else do you need?  Another star knocked off.No issue really with the product,  the capsules are very fragile, and when they arrived about 1/3 of them were dented,  causing some issues with the pressure required by the machine to make good crema espresso.  At about 70 cents a pop that gets a bit pricey.  I have yet to receive an answer from amazon,  the third party did contact me and encouraged me to contact amazon and include any pictures I took, which I did include,  pictures of the smashed boxes,  and dented capsules.  Generally I have terrific luck with amazon, but time it seems to have fallen through the cracks a bit.  Just know that on these capsules also to make sure the previous capsule has dropped into the bin,  because if you pull the lever down and the capsule isn't seated correctly it will crush and be useless.
